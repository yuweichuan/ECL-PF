# Details
The scripts are about exhaustive cross-linking search with protein feedback in mass spectrometry (ECL-PF). ECL-PF can seach cleavable cross-linking data in a very sensitive way. The usage of the tool can be observed from Tutorial.pdf. More information and testing example can be found at https://bioinformatics.hkust.edu.hk/Software/ECL-PF.html
